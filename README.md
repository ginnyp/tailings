#### About Our Project

Mining natural resources enables our modern society, however, the process of extracting metals and minerals from the earth creates a large amount of waste. Tailings are the materials left over from the mining process. They must be stored by mining companies, sometimes in lakes that are contained by dams, or in large piles that can become as tall as mountains. Tailings can be a source of toxic chemicals, and some storage methods may fail in ways that are catastrophic for the surrounding communities, such as the [collapse of the Brumadinho tailings dam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brumadinho_dam_disaster) in Brazil in 2019, which killed 270 people and polluted the local water supply. Tailings can also be a source of valuable resources, such as [critical minerals](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/22/fact-sheet-securing-a-made-in-america-supply-chain-for-critical-minerals/), such as cobalt, lithium, and rare earths.

Organizations like [Regeneration]([https://www.resolve.ngo/regeneration.htm](https://www.regeneration.enterprises/)) are workign with mining companies to extract value from stored tailings, then transform the sites so that they no longer pose a threat to the environment and the communities nearby. Our project supports this work by using a machine learning algorithm on satellite imagery to identify tailings. Then, we will provide an interactive map of our identified tailings site with information about the area that will provide insight on the resources that may be found in the tailings waste.
