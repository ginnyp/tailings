# Github Integration with Colab and GEE

## Colab

* [Google's Demo Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb#scrollTo=wKJ4bd5rt1wy)
* Easier for notebooks to be public
* Private notebooks require an additional authorization step

## Google Earth Engine Code Editor

* The [Script Manager](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/playground) stores scripts in Git repositories that are hosted by Google
* Respositories can also be synced with external systems like GitHub
* Google suggests referencing [this tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git) provided by Github
* [This post}(https://samapriyaroy.medium.com/getting-git-right-on-google-earth-engine-e853f6551889) may also be helpful
